    "goodPractices": "In my first startup job collaborated with the design and development team, to implement new features applying the feedback received from users to increase the NPS and improving acquisition rate.\n\nI like to work with a user-centered design and if possible having metrics that give us light, understanding and analyzing their problems and needs, to provide the best solution.\n\nFinally in visual design step I like to build design systems and to work on defining the foundations and library of components to be used in the product, website or whatever piece of design each member of the design team is working on in order to be consistent.",
